# Alerting

> Alerting is still in very early development. Please be aware.

The roadmap for alerting in Grafana have been changing rapidly during last 2-3 months. So make sure you follow the disucssion in the [alerting issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/2209).

## Introduction

> Alerting is turned off by default and have to be enabled in the config file.

Grafana lets you define alert rules based on metrics queries on dashboards. Every alert is connected to a panel and when ever the query for the panel is updated the alerting rule is also updated.
So far only the graph panel supports alerting. To enable alerting for a panel go to the alerting tab and press 'Create alert' button.

## Alert status page

You can overview all your current alerts on the alert stats page at /alerting

## Alert notifications

When an alert is triggered it goes to the notification handler who takes care of sending emails or push data as webhooks.
The alert notifications can be configured on /alerting/notifications
